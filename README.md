### Files preparation (music and lrc files)
Before using the player, you'll need to download your songs and lyrics in advance. I use Zotify to download songs from Spotify, and for LRC lyrics files, I recommend using LrcGet, Syrics on your laptop, or SongSync on Android. There are also various websites where you can download music with embedded metadata and lyrics.

- [Zotify](https://github.com/zotify-dev/zotify)
- [LrcGet](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget)
- [Syrics](https://github.com/akashrchandran/syrics)
- [SongSync](https://github.com/Lambada10/SongSync)
 
### Installation

- An installer for Windows is available in the releases section(outdated). However, since I don't use Windows, creating an installer can be tedious. So, I will only create an installer for major updates. I recommend running the program directly from the Python file for the best experience, as daily updates and bug fixes will be released frequently. [Download Windows Installer](https://github.com/amm926616/april-music-player-os/releases/download/windows-installers/april-open-source-v1.1-setup.exe)


- To run the project with Python, clone or download the repository:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/amm926616/april-music-player.git` or download the repo.

- Go inside the folder.
    
- (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

    `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
    
- Install the required modules:

    `pip install -r requirements/requirements-windows.txt` for windows and `pip install -r requirements/requirements-linux.txt` for linux.
    
- Run the main script:
    
    `python main.py`

- Later, maybe you can create your own shortcut or script to automate the running process.
